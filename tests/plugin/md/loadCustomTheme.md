# Remark-Highlighter

This is a remark plugin which enables you to add syntax highlighting to your code blocks (both fenced and inline codes).
It's uses [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) under the hood to highlight your code.

Due to this, you are able to use any theme which is supported in VS Code; plus, you can also load your custom themes too _(as many as you want)_.

## Install

- pnpm
  `pnpm add -D remark-highlighter`
- yarn
  `yarn add -D remark-highlighter`
- npm
  `npm add -D remark-highlighter`
```
